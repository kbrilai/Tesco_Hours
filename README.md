# Tesco_Hours
I'm Manually Tracking my hours on tesco shifts at the moment until i get a sign in, sign out card. This is my raw datasource. I'd like to do an analysis on how many hours are planned, against unexpected overtime. Spliced on a Week by Week, Month on Month Time series analysis. 

The layout of this is going to be done like this: 

Input: googleforms to log shifts
database: google sheets 
data cleaning: SQL on GCP
Visualisation: Tableau
